# Data Structures

## [Merkle Mountain Range](./mmr/)
A Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) is a data structure which aids in producing compact proofs for elements within the structure and cheap appends.
Their design also allows for cheap and efficient data queries, particularly when reading sequential data from large datasets. 


## [Ethereum Merkle Patricia Tree](./eth_mpt.cairo)
The Ethereum Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT) is a modified version of the Merkle Tree. MPTs are used in Ethereum to store accounts, transactions, receipts and storage.
